# Assembly Memory Access Violation Bug Report

This repository demonstrates a common assembly language bug: a memory access violation caused by the instruction `mov eax, [ebx+4*ecx]`. This instruction can lead to crashes or unpredictable behavior if the memory address calculated is invalid.

## Bug Description
The instruction `mov eax, [ebx+4*ecx]` attempts to read a value from memory.  However, if the calculation `ebx + 4 * ecx` results in an invalid memory address (e.g., outside the bounds of allocated memory, or pointing to a freed memory region), a memory access violation exception occurs.

## Possible Causes:
* **Buffer Overflow:**  `ecx` may contain a value that, when multiplied by 4 and added to `ebx`, exceeds the bounds of the allocated buffer.
* **Incorrect Pointer Arithmetic:** The calculation might be incorrect if `ebx` is not properly aligned or the data size is not 4 bytes.
* **Dangling Pointer:** `ebx` might point to memory that has been freed, causing a segmentation fault.

## Reproducing the Bug:
The `bug.asm` file contains the problematic code. Assembling and running this code will likely result in a memory access violation (depending on the values of `ebx` and `ecx` during execution).

## Solution:
The `bugSolution.asm` file shows how to avoid this bug by carefully checking the memory address before access and implementing bounds checking to prevent buffer overflows.  Always validate pointers and ensure proper array indexing.
