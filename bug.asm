mov eax, [ebx+4*ecx]

This instruction can cause an exception if the memory address calculated by `ebx+4*ecx` is not valid.  This often happens due to:

* **Buffer overflow:** `ecx` might hold a value that leads to accessing memory outside the allocated buffer.
* **Incorrect pointer arithmetic:** The calculation `ebx+4*ecx` may be wrong if `ebx` is not a properly aligned pointer or if the size of the data being accessed is not 4 bytes.
* **Dangling pointer:** `ebx` might point to memory that has been freed or is no longer valid.
